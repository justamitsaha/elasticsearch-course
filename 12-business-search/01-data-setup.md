## Data setup

### docker-compose

```yaml
services:
  elastic:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.0
    ports:
    - 9200:9200
    environment:
    - discovery.type=single-node
    - xpack.security.enabled=false
    - xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false
  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.17.0
    ports:
    - 5601:5601
    environment:
    - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elastic:9200
  data-setup:
    image: vinsdocker/elasticsearch-business-datasetup
    profiles:
      - data-setup
    environment:
    - ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://elastic:9200
```

### Instructions

 - pull this image as it might take some time - `docker pull vinsdocker/elasticsearch-business-datasetup:latest`
 - Run this command `docker compose up`
 - This will start `elasticsearch` and `kibana`. NOT `data-setup`.
 - Wait for elasticsearch and kibana to be up and running.
 - Open another terminal and navigate to the path where you have this yaml file.
 - Run this command `docker compose run --rm data-setup`. This will start the data-setup service to setup the indices and add the data.
